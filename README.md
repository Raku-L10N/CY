NAME
====

L10N::CY - Welsh localization of Raku

SYNOPSIS
========

    $ ryuuu -e 'dywedyd "Helo Byd"'
    Helo Byd

```raku
use L10N::NL;
dywedyd "Helo Byd"
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

The `L10N::JA` distribution contains the logic to provide a Japanese localization of the Raku Programming Language. It installs a `ryuuu` executable that will automatically activate the Japanese localization. And it allows one to use the Japanese localization in selected programs with a `use L10N::JA` statement.
